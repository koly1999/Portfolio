			This project was done for my highschool science olympiad team. The goal was
			to make an autonomous electric car that could stop itself at a set distance,
			and fit into a 1 meter cubed box.
			The car had to be electric and could only be started by pressing a
			button with the eraser end of a pencil.
			The car then had to start and stop itself completley autonomously after traveling a set distance.
			The chalenging part of this event was that we didnt know exacly how far our autonomous car had to travel before stopping.
			we would be told how far it had to travel before stopping when we arrived the day of the event.
			All we knew beforehand was they could tell us the car had to come to a stop anywhere between 8 and 20 meters.
			We would be scored based on 2 criteria, how quickly our car went down the track, and then how close to the target distance it got.

				This was our first iteration of the electric car.
				We started by taking the guts of a remote controlled car, and transplanting them onto a wooden base.
				This version had a few problems sadly. Firstly it had rubber wheels; they didn't provide much grip on the average gym floor, causing the car to spin out when started.
				Secondly the electric motor we picked was way too powerful and would cause the car to spin its tires instead of going forward.
				Thirdly our mechanism for stopping the car at a set distance was not very reliable.
				Since we could be told to make our car stop through a wide range of distances we needed a more consistent and accurate mechanism than the one we developed.

				This is a close up of the gearing and drive system at the rear of our electric car.
				This spur gear would also drive a long screw thread rod that had a deadman switch attached to it.
				When the car was driving the deadman switch would coast down the threaded rod, and when it reached our desired distance the switch would cut power to the motor and the car would stop.
				Unfortunately the car never seemed to stop on time, and the threaded rod was not fine enough for us to accurately set it at the stopping points.

				This was version 2 of the car.
				Despite the more crude appearance of the car, this one was far more consistent.
				We swapped the rubber wheels for foam ones that gripped gym floors better.
				The smaller motor was still very fast but it started up slower, resulting in no wheel spin when the car first starts up.
				The simpler and smaller front wheels were angled more aggressively like that of a drag racing car to ensure that the vehicle only went in a straight line, that way we would deviate as little as possible from the target distance.
				The last major improvement, and probably the most important we made was to the stopping mechanism.
				Our stopping mechanism was the exact same as our previous one, however the screw thread was much more fine, allowing for more accuracy.
				It also was on an independant gear that came off of the drive motor, making it more reliable, and giving us more space to measure stopping distances.
				However when the dead man's switch was activated by the stopper, the car would still coast for a while before actually stopping, and it still drifted off center, making us lose points.
